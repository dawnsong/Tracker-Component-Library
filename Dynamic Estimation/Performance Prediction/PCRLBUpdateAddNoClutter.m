function JPost=PCRLBUpdateAddNoClutter(JPred,xCur,PCur,R,PD,param6,xi,w)
%PCRLBUPDATEADDNOCLUTTER Update the Fisher information matrix (FIM) for a
%            measurement with additive noise (in the coordinate system of
%            the measurement), a possibly non-unity detection probability,
%            but with no clutter. The FIM for the information reduction
%            factor PCRLB is used.
%
%INPUTS:    JPred       The Fisher information matrix predicted forward to
%                       the current time-step. If this is the first step
%                       with a measurement, then JPred should be the zero
%                       matrix.
%           xCur        The (column vector) mean of the distribution of the
%                       true (but unknown to the tracker) possible target
%                       location at the current time. It is assumed that
%                       the distribution of the target location is
%                       Gaussian.
%           PCur        The covariance of the distribution of the true (but
%                       unknown to the tracker) possible target location at
%                       the current time. If the target motion is
%                       deterministic but unknown to the tracker, then
%                       PCur is a matrix of zeros.
%           R           The covariance matrix of the additive measurement
%                       noise.
%           PD          The detection probability of the target at the
%                       current step.
%           param6      Either the fixed measurement matrix H (which is
%                       zDimX xDim), or a function handle HJacob to get the 
%                       measurement Jacobian, which is zDim X xDim where
%                       each row corresponds to a component of the
%                       measurement vector and the column is the derivative
%                       of the row component with respect the part of the
%                       state vector corresponding to the column. The
%                       function must take the state as its parameter.
%           xi, w       If a function handle is passed for param6 and
%                       PCur is not a zero matrix, then cubature points for
%                       integration are needed. xi and w are the cubature
%                       points and weights. The cubature points must be the
%                       dimensionality of the state.
%
%OUTPUT:    JPost       The Fisher information matrix after a measurement
%                       update.
%
%A basic description of using cubature integration for evaluating the PCRLB
%is given in [1], where it is also described how to use a prior
%distribution to evaluate the PCRLB for a simulation of random tracks
%without running Monte Carlo runs. The prior distribution parameters in
%such an instance can be calculated using the function DiscPriorPModel.
%
%The general form of the PCRLB measurement update step with a non-unity
%detection probability but no clutter is from [2].
%
%If multiple independent measurement are available at a particular time,
%then this function can be called multiple times to sequentially update the
%Fisher information matrix.
