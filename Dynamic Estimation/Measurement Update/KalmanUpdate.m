function [xUpdate,PUpdate,innov,Pzz]=KalmanUpdate(xPred,PPred,z,R,H)
%KALMANUPDATE Perform the measurement update step in the standard linear
%             Kalman filter. This assumes that the predicted target state
%             and the measurement are both multivariate Gaussian
%             distributed.
%
%INPUTS:    xPred     The xDim X 1 predicted target state.
%           PPred     The xDim X xDim predicted state covariance matrix.
%           z         The zDim X 1 vector measurement.
%           R         The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix. 
%           H         The zDim X xDim measurement matrix for a linear
%                     measurement model. That is z=H*x+w, where w is
%                     measurement noise having covariance matrix R.
%
%OUTPUTS:      xUpdate  The xDim X 1 updated state vector.
%              PUpdate  The updated xDim X xDim state covariance matrix.
%           innov, Pzz  The zDimX1 innovation and the zDimXzDim innovation
%                       covariance matrix are returned in case one wishes
%                       to analyze the consistency of the estimator or use
%                       those values in gating or likelihood evaluation.
%
%Given a prediction of the target state xPred with an associated covariance
%matrix PPred, and assuming that they are the mean and covariance matrix of
%a Gaussian distribution, under the measurement model
%z=H*x+w
%where z is the measurement, x is the truye target state, H is a zDim*xDim
%matrix and w is additive Gaussian noise, this function updates the mstate
%estimate and its associated covariance estimate.
%
%The Joseph-form covariance update is used for improved numerical
%stability. The algorithm is derived in Chapter 5 of [1].
