function [yUpdate, PInvUpdate]=infoFilterUpdate(yPred,PInvPred,z,R,H)
%%INFOFILTERUPDATE Perform the measurement update step in the standard 
%                  linear information filter.
%
%INPUTS: yPred      The xDimX1 predicted information state. The information
%                   state is the inverse covariance matrix times the target
%                   state.
%        PInvPred   The xDimXxDim inverse of the predicted state covariance
%                   matrix.
%        z          The zDim X 1 vector measurement.
%        R          The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix. 
%        H          The zDim X xDim measurement matrix for a linear
%                   measurement model. That is z=H*x+w, where w is
%                   measurement noise having covariance matrix R.
%
%OUTPUTS: yUpdate     The xDim X 1 updated (posterior) information state
%                     vector.
%         PInvUpdate  The updated xDim X xDim inverse state covariance
%                     matrix.
%
%The information filter is algebraically equivalent to the standard linear
%Kalman filter, but allows for track propagation with very uncertain
%states, such as when starting tracks. The implementation of the update
%given here is from the flow chart given in Appendix H of [1].
%
%The standard information filter has the implied linear measurement
%equation
%z=H*x+w
%where z is the measurement, w is the zero-mean Gaussian measurement noise
%with covariance matrix R and x is the true state. However, instead of
%propagating the true state x with its covariance matrix P, the information
%filter propagates
%y=inv(P)*x
%and instead of propagating the true covariance matrix P, it propagates
%PInv=inv(P)
%which means that the filter can be used even when PInv is singular.
%
%More information on information filtering is given in Chapter 7.2 of [2]
