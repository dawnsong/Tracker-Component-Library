function zGround=proj2Ellips(z,a,f)
%%PROJ2ELLIPS   Given a point in three-dimensional space, find the point on
%               a reference ellipsoid that is closest. This approximately
%               finds the point on the ground (ignoring terrain) that is
%               closest to a given arbitrary point.
%
%INPUTS:    z       A point in [x;y;z] Cartesian coordinates.
%           a       The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                   this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f       The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                   this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%OUTPUTS:  zGround  The point on the surface of the reference ellipsoid
%                   that is closest to the ground.
%
%This just transforms the given point into latitude, longitude and
%altitude, sets the altitude to zero and converts back to Cartesian
%coordinates. The function used for the conversion from Cartesian to
%ellipsoidal coordinates assumes that the point in question is not too
%close to the center of the Earth.
