function vLocal=getLocalVectors(vGlobal,uList)
%%GETGLOBALVECTORS Change a collection of local vectors into global
%                  vectors using the local coordinate axes. This multiplies
%                  the components of the vectors by the corresponding
%                  coordinate axis vectors.
%
%INPUTS:  vGlobal  A 3XN matrix of N global vectors that are to be
%                  converted.              
%           uList  A 3X3XN matrix of orthonormal unit coordinate axes that
%                  are associated with the local coordinate system in which
%                  the vectors are expressed. If all N vectors use the same
%                  local coordinate system, then a 3x3x1 matrix may be
%                  passed instead.
%
%OUTPUTS:   vLocal The vectors in the local coordinate system.
