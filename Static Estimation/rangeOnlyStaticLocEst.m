%%RANGEONLYSTATICLOCEST  Given multiple bistatic range-only measurements
%                        consisting of one receiver and multiple
%                        transmitters (or vice versa), find the location of
%                        a target in 3D. Covariance matrices for the
%                        estimate are also available. A minimum of 3
%                        receivers (or transmitters) is necessary.
%                        
%INPUTS:    rBi  A numMeas X 1 vector of bistatic range measurements where
%                numMeas>3 to ensure observability.
%           zLoc1  A 3 X numMeas vector of transmitter location vectors, if
%                  one receiver and multiple transmitters are used. If one
%                  transmitter and multiple receivers are used, then zLoc1
%                  should be a 3 X numMeas vector of receiver locations.
%           zLoc2  A 3X1 vector of the receiver locations, if multiple
%                  transmitters are used, or a 3X1 vector of the
%                  transmitter location if multiple receivers are used.
%           RCov If a covariance matrix for the estimate is desired on the
%                output, then RCov, a measurement covariance matrix must be
%                provided. Otherwise, RCov can be omitted as the algorithm
%                implicitely assumes that all of the measurements have the
%                same accuracy.
%
%OUTPUTS:   xEst    The Cartesian target location estimate. If onlt the
%                   minimum number of receivers/ transmitters is provided
%                   (3), then there are two columns, each corresponding to
%                   one of the two solutions.
%           PTaylor A covariance matrix for the estimate based on a Taylor
%                   series expansion. then this is a 3D matrix, with the
%                   extra dimension selecting the solution for which the
%                   covairance matrix is valid.
%           PCRLB   A covariance matrix (or matrices for two solutions) for
%                   the estimates) based on the Cramér-Rao lower bound.
%
%The target localization algorithm is based on the spherical intersection
%method of [1], where the Taylor series expansion covariance matrix for the
%estimate is also derived. The PCRLB covariance estimate is standard
%assuming additive Gaussian noise.
