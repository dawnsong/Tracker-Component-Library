function [latLonEnd,azEnd]=directGeodeticProbGen(latLonStart,azStart,dist,height,a,f,numSteps4Circ)
%%DIRECTGEODETICPROBGEN  Solve the direct geodetic problem. That is, given
%                     an initial point and an initial bearing an
%                     ellipsoidal Earth, find the end point and final
%                     bearing if one were to travel one or more given
%                     distances along a geodesic curve (the shortest curve
%                     between two points on a curved surface). This
%                     function is general in that it will also solve the
%                     direct geodetic problem at a fixed height above the
%                     reference ellipsoid, if desired.
%
%INPUTS:latLonStart A 2XN matrix of N starting points given in geodetic 
%                   latitude and longitude in radians. that is, each column
%                   is [latitude;longitude]; 
%         azStart   An NX1 or 1XN vector of the forward azimuth (initial
%                   headings) at the starting point in radians East of true
%                   North on the reference ellipsoid.
%           dist    An NX1 or 1XN vector of the distances in meters 
%                   that will be traveled on the geodesic curve starting at
%                   latLonStart with initial heading azStart where
%                   solutions are desired.
%         height    An NX1 or 1XN vector of the heights above the reference
%                   ellipsoid at which the trajectories should be
%                   determined. If this parameter is omitted, then the
%                   default value of 0 is used for all of the trajectories.
%           a       The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid (in
%                   meters). If this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f       The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                   this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%   numSteps4Circ   If height!=0, then an algorithm propagating a state
%                   in ECEF coordinates around the curved Earth is used.
%                   This parameter determines the number of steps that
%                   would be needed for a target that circumnavigates the
%                   globe around the equator. The default value if this
%                   parameter is not provided is 2000. A value of 6000
%                   appears to be about the best number for overall
%                   precision. Reducing the number of steps will speed up
%                   the function. This parameter is not used if height=0.
%
%OUTPUTS:latLonEnd  A2XN matrix of geodetic latitude and longitudes of the
%                   final points of the geodesic trajectory given in
%                   radians as [latitude;longitude].
%        azEnd      An NX1 vector of rhe forward azimuth (bearing) at the
%                   ending points in radians East of true North on the
%                   reference ellipsoid.

%system for the return values.

%Note that the function is significantly faster if height=0.
