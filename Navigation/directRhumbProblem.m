%%DIRECTRHUMBLINEPROBLEM Given a starting location on the surface of the
%                        reference ellipsoid as well as a constant heading
%                        a distance to travel, determine the location of a
%                        vessel traveling at the constant heading after
%                        traveling the distance. A constant heading
%                        trajectory is a rhumb line (loxodrome) and is
%                        usually not the shortest path between two points.
%
%INPUTS: latLonStart  A 2X1 vector of the starting ellipsoidal latitude
%                     (North) and longitude (East) in radians.
%            azimuth  The constant heading that is to be traveled in
%                     radians East of North.
%               dist  The distance that is to be traveled on a constant
%                     heading course.
%              height The heights above the reference ellipsoid at which
%                     the trajectoriey should be determined. If this
%                     parameter is omitted, then the default value of 0 is
%                     used.
%                a    The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                     this argument is omitted, the value in
%                     Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%                f    The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                     this argument is omitted, the value in
%                     Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%     numSteps4Circ   If height!=0, then an algorithm propagating a state
%                     in ECEF coordinates around the curved Earth is used.
%                     This parameter determines the number of steps that
%                     would be needed for a target that circumnavigates the
%                     globe around the equator. The default value if this
%                     parameter is not provided is 2000. A value of 6000
%                     appears to be about the best number for overall
%                     precision. Reducing the number of steps will speed up
%                     the function. This parameter is not used if height=0.
%
%OUTPUTS: latLonEnd  The ellipsoidal latitude and longitude that one will
%                    be after starting at latLonStart and traveling a
%                    distance of dist at a constant heading on azimuth.
%
%The algorithm for zero-altitude is taken from [1]. However, a formula
%using isometric latitudes, which are described in Chapter 3 of [2] to get
%the azimuth angle was used, because it is simpler. The formula is
%also explicitely mentioned in Equation 2 of [3]. However, the expression
%for computing the distance from [3] is only for a sphere, not for an
%ellipsoid, which is why the Carlton-Wippern distance computation using an
%incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind is preferred.
%
%The algorithm is generally the opposite of indirectRhumbProblem, except
%when a starting or ending point is at a geographic pole, as discussed in
%the comments to the indirectRhumbProblem function.
%
%The solution for a non-zero altitude is based on [4]. The function is
%significantly faster if a zero altitude is used.
