External libraries that are called by functions within the Tracker Component Library are kept here. In many instances, only a few of the routines in the library are used, though with the exception of the SGP4 library, the entire libraries are provided here. None of the parts of the external libraries that are used is subject to copyleft restrictions, though they have varying licenses. The Splitting Conic Solver Library can use some routines that rely on a library that is under an LGPL (copylefted) license. Those routines are not used and have been placed in a zip archive.

The sources of the external libraries are as follows:

1) The dividing rectangles algorithm for global optimization is taken from the NLOpt library at

2) GeographicLib:

3) LibAIS for decoding data from ships' transponders:
