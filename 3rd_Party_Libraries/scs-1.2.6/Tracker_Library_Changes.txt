The files Makefile, scs.mk and appveyor.yml as well as the folders java, python, and r and some subfolders of examples were compressed into "Unused Code.zip".

In order to keep all code with licenses containing copyleft provisions or that force modifications to be published out of the Tracker Component Library, the files related to the compiled version of the "direct" version of the splitting conic solver have deleted. The compile script make_scs.m was modified to be consistent with the removal of this code. Additionally, the GPU code was put into an unused code archive as it is not used.

As the direct algorithm is no longer available in a compiled version, the Matlab implementation of the direct algorithm in the examples folder is used instead. The file scs_matlab was modified so that it uses the params.verbose option that is available in the compiled version and it only displays outputs if verbose is true.
