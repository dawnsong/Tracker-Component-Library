%%CLOSESTPOINTBETWEEN2LINES Given two non-parallel lines in 3D that do not
%                           necessarily intersect, find the point closest
%                           to both lines. This is done by finding the
%                           point on each line that is closes to the other
%                           line, and then averaging the points (get the
%                           point halfway between the lines).
%
%INPUTS: a1,b1  3XN matrix of parameters for the first line in N pairs of
%               lines, the closes point between each being desired. The ith
%               line is represented in parametic form as
%               r=a1(:,i)*t+b1(:,i), where t is a scalar parameter and r is
%               a point on the line.
%        a2,b2  The 3XN set of parameters for the second lines.
%                           
%OUTPUTS: midpoint The 3XN set of closest points between each of the N
%                  pairs of lines.
%         minDist  NX1 set of minimum distances between the pairs of lines.
%
%Line 1 is r1=a1*t1+b1 and line 2 is r2=a2*t2+b2. We want to find the
%values of t1 and t2 such that norm(r1-r2)^2 is minimized.
%norm(r1-r2)^2=norm(a1*t1+b1-a2*t2-b2)^2
%             =norm(A*T+c)^2 where A=[a1,-a2] and c=b1-b2 and T=[t1;t2]
%             =T'*A'*A*T+2*c'*A*T+c'*c
%Setting the derivative with respect to the vector T equal to zero, we get
%             2*A'*A*T+2*A'*c=0
%The solution is T=-inv(A'*A)*A'*c, which (being the zero deivative point) is
%an extrema and being the only extrema (unless the lines are parallel) is
%the closest point between the lines. The pinv function is used to evaluate
%(A'*A)\A' as it is more stable.
