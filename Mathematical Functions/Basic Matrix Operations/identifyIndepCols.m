function colIdx=identifyIndepCols(A,tol)
%%IDENTIFYINDEPCOLS  Given a matrix A, which can be square or rectangular,
%                    find a linearly independent subset of the columns.
%                    The total number of linearly independent columns is
%                    determined by the rank function.
%
%INPUTS: A  A matrix whereby a linearly independent subset of columns is
%           desired.
%       tol An optional parameter specifying the tolerance for determinaing
%           the rank of the matrix. If omitted, the value
%           tol=max(size(A))*eps(norm(A)) is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: colIdx A vector of the indices of linearly independent columns of
%                A. The indices are ordered in terms of increasing
%                magnitude of the diagonal of R is a QR decomposition.
%
%The use of a QR decomposition with column pivoting for finding linearly
%independent columns is described in Chapter 5.5 of [1].
