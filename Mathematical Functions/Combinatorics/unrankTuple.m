function tuple=unrankTuple(rank,maxVals)
%%UNRANKTUPLE Obtain the tuple corresponding to its order in the sequence
%             of tuples given a certain set of maximum values for each
%             digit.
%
%INPUTS: rank The rank of the tuple in the order of increasing tuples where
%             the first digit is the most significant. This ranges from 0
%             to the total possible number of tuples-1. The total number of
%             tuples depends on maxVals.
%     maxVals An NX1 or 1XN vector of the maximum value that each digit
%             of the tuple can take.
%
%OUTPUTS: tuple The NX1 tuple corresponding to the given rank.
%
%The index2NDim function actually unranks tuples, but it assumes that the
%digits of the tuples start from 1, not zero and that the rank starts from
%1, not zero. This function just calls index2NDim with the appropriate
%parameters.
