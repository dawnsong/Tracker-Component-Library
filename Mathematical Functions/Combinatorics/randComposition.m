function q=randComposition(t,n)
%%RANDCOMPOSITION Generate a random composition of n unlableled items and t
%                 slots. That is, a random assignment of putting n
%                 unlabeled balls into t labeled slots. This will not work
%                 if the total number of possible compositions
%                 (binomial(n-1,d-1)) is so large as to overflow.
%
%INPUTS:    m      The number of slots that can hold items.
%           n      The number of items that are composed into slots.
%
%OUTPUTS:    q      An mX1 vector holding the random composition, whose
%                   elements sum to n. Each element is the number of
%                   "balls" in that slot.
%
%This function just generates a random rank and unranks that composition
%using the unrankComposition function.
