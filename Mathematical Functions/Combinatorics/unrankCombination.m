function combo=unrankCombination(rank,n,m,firstElMostSig)
%%UNRANKCOMBIANTION Return the combination of the given rank in the
%                   lexicographic ordering of combinations consisting of
%                   m elements chosen from a total set of n elements,
%                   where the first element of combo is the least
%                   significant, unless otherwise specified.
%
%INPUTS:    rank    The order of the desired combination in lexicographic
%                   order. Note that 0<=rank<binomial(n,k).
%           n       The number of items from which m items are chosen for
%                   the ranked combinations.
%           m       The number of items chosen.
%    firstElMostSig An optional parameter specifying whether the first
%                   element is the most or least significant. The default
%                   if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false (the
%                   first element is the least significant).
%
%OUTPUTS:   combo   An mX1 vector containing the combination with values in
%                   INCREASING order. The lowest item is indexed zero. If a
%                   rank equal to or greater than the total number of
%                   unique combinations is given, then an empty matrix is
%                   returned.
%
%The rank represents the  combinatorial number system of degree m,
%where m is the length of the vector comb. The system is described in
%Chapter 7.2.1.3 of [1]. Under that system, it can be observed that the
%first time the highest-value element of a combination vector acquaires a
%new value, all of the other terms in the binomial sum needed to find the
%rank are zero. Thus, one can pick off values in a ranked combinations
%similarly to how one might use logarithms repeatedly to extract the digits
%of a number.
