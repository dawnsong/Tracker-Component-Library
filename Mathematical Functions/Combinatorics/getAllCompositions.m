function tuples=getAllCompositions(d,sumVal)
%%GETALLCOMPOSITIONS Find all permutations of d positive (nonzero) integers
%                   that sum to a given constant sumVal (constant-sum
%                   d-tuples). That is, find all compositions of sumVal
%                   into d parts such that no part is ever empty.
%
%INPUTS:      d The integer dimensionality of the vectors of integers to
%               generate.
%        sumVal The integer value that the sum of the elements of the
%               vectors should have.
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A dXnumTuples matrix of column vectors such that the sum
%                across rows for each column equals d. All elements are
%                >=1. If sumVal<d, then an empty matrix is returned. The
%                tuples are not in lexicographic order. There is a total of
%                numTuples=binomial(sumVal-1,d-1);
%
%Often, one might prefer all partitions of d integers that sum to a
%constant value sumVal INCLUDING zeros. This function can be used to
%produce such a modified set of partitions as
%tuples=getAllCompositions(d,sumVal+d)-1;
%
%The algorithm is based on Algorithm 8.1.1 of [1]. It is also given in
%Appendix C of [2]. Unlike in the references, the special cases of d=sumVal
%and d<sumVal are treated here. Also, the array of tuples to be returned is
%preallocated so that it does not change size each loop.
%
%To preallocate the array, one has to know the total number of tuples that
%sum to a particular value. To determine the total number of possible
%tuples:
%Consider a series of sumVal ones. One has to place d-1 commas between
%them. These d-1 commas partition the set into d subsets. The sums of the d
%subsets are the values of an element in a tuple. This means that there are
%consequently binomial(sumVal-1,d-1) possible tuples.
%
%One can observe that for d=3, starting with sumVal=3 and going up, the
%number of tuples is given by triangular numbers. For d=4, increasing
%sumVal from 4, one gets tetrahedral numbers; for d=5, increasing sumVal
%from 5, one gets pentatope numbers. One can see the pattern of figurate
%numbers arising from the number of possible tuples that sum to a given
%value.
