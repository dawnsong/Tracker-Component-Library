function [thePartition,r,m,d]=getNextPartition(n,r,m,d)
%%GETNEXTPARTITION  Get the next partition of the integer n. A partition is
%                   a set of other integers that sum to n. This goes
%                   through all possible partitions in reverse
%                   lexicographic order. If this function is called only
%                   with n, then the first partition is returned. The
%                   values r, m, and d are needed to get subsequent
%                   partitions. If the last partition is passed, then an
%                   empty matrix is returned. The total number of
%                   partitions for a given n can be found using the
%                   numberOfPartitions function. Unlike the function
%                   getNextMPartition, this goes through partitions of n
%                   into all numbers of parts, whereas getNextMPartition
%                   only goes through partitions of m parts.
%
%INPUTS:    n  A positive integer that one wishes to partition. If this is
%              the only parameter passed, then the first partition in
%              reverse lexicographic order is returned.
%           r  A parameter needed to get subsequent partitions that is
%              returned by this function upon generating a partition. The
%              first d entries are all of the digits in the partition,
%              without repeats. The other elements are needed to compute
%              future partitions.
%           m  A vector specifying the number of times that the digits in r
%              are repeated. This is returned by this function and has to
%              be passed to get subsequent partitions.
%           d  The number of elements in r and m that contribute to the
%              current partition. This is returned by this function and has
%              to be passed to get subsequent partitions.
%
%OUTPUTS: thePartition The next partition, which is also encoded in the
%                      returned values of r, m, and d. The elements are in
%                      DECREASING order. This is a series of integers that
%                      sum to n. If n is the only parameter passed, then
%                      this is the first partition. If the parameters for
%                      the final partition were passed, then this is an
%                      empty matrix.
%           r,m,d      The updated values of r, m, and d that should be
%                      passed to get the next partition. Note that the
%                      entire partition is encoded in r, m, and d.
%
%The algorithm is the algorithm NEXPAR taken from Chapter 9 of [1].
%
%The function is called as
%[thePartition,r,m,d]=getNextPartition(n);
%to get the first parition and as
%[thePartition,r,m,d]=getNextPartition(n,r,m,d);
%to get subsequent partitions.
