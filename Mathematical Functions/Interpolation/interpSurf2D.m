function [zInterp,gradInterp,gradDerivMatInterp]=interpSurf2D(xyPoints,xyPointsRef,zPointsRef,smoothTerm)
%%INTERPSURF2D  Given a set of values zPointsRef at the 2D points
%               xyPointsRef that define a surface, interpolate to the
%               points given in xyPoints and evaluate the interpolated z-
%               value, the gradient, and the partial derivatives of the
%               interpolated gradeint at the points.
%
%INPUTS: xyPoints A 2XN set of N 2D (x,y) points at which interplation and
%                 gradeints are desired.
%     xyPointsRef The 2XnumRef set of numRef (x,y) points in two-dimensions
%                 that define the locations at which the zPointsRef
%                 (surface heights) are provided. There should be no
%                 repeated (or very numerically close) points and the
%                 points should not all be collinear/ nearly collinear.
%      zPointsRef The numRefX1 or 1XnumRef set of heights at the reference
%                 points xyPointsRef.
%      smoothTerm An optional positive term that afects how smooth the
%                 interpolated surface is. Higher values make the surface
%                 smoother. If omitted, a default value of 0 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: zInterp The NX1 vector of interpolated z value at the points
%                 given in xyPoints.
%      gradInterp The 2XnumRef gradients of the interpolated surface
%                 evaluated at the points in xyPoints.
%gradDerivMatInterp The 2X2XnumRef second derivative matrices of the
%                 interpolated surface at the points of interest.
%
%The 2D surface from which the derivatives are derived is found using the
%hyperbolic multiquadratic method. The algorithm is cited to originate in
%[1]. However, that paper was not consulted in implementing the routine.
%Rather the summaries given in [2] and [3] where the routine is compared to
%a number of other algorithms were used.
%
%None of those methods explicitely provides the derivatives, but analytic
%derivatives for the interpolating function are simple to find.
%The interpolating function is
%fInterp(x,y)=sum_{i=1}^{numRef} c_i sqrt((x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2+smoothTerm)
%Where the x_i and y_i are the refernce points and the c_i terms are found
%by solving numRef linear equations so that the interpolation equation
%matches the points at points in zPointsRef at the reference x and y
%values.
