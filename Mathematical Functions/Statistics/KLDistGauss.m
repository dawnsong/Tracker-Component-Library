%%KLDISTGAUSS Obtain the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between two
%             multivariate Gaussian distributions.
%
%INPUTS: mu   An xDim X 2 matrix of the mean vectors of the 2 Gaussian
%             distributions whose KL distance is desired.
%        P    An xDim X xDim X2 hypermatrix of the covariance matrices of
%             the two distributions whose KL distance is desired.
%
%OUTPUTS: KLDis The KL distance between the two distributions.
%
%The KL distance between the PDF f_1(x) and the PDF f_2(x) is given by
%integral f_1(x)*log(f_1(x)/f_2(x)) dx
%The KL distance can be difference if f_1 and f_2 are switched. Here,
%mu(:,1) and P(:,:,1) correspond to f_1 and mu(:,2) and P(:,:,2) to f_2.
%
%The expression for the Kullback Leibler distance between two multivariate
%Gaussian distributions is from Theorem 1 of [1].
