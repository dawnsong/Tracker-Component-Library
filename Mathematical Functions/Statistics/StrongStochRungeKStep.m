%%STRONGSTOCHRUNGEKSTEP Simulate a nonlinear continuous-time random
%                       process specified by the Langevin equation forward
%                       in time by a step-size of deltaT using a strong
%                       Taylor scheme.
%
%INPUTS: method  An integer defining which weak Taylor method to use.
%                1  The explicit order 1.5 strong Taylor scheme with
%                   additive noise. This requires the diffusion function to
%                   be additive.
%                2  The order 1.5 strong Taylor scheme with additive noise.
%                   This requires the diffusion function to be additive.
%        xCur    The initial target state at time curT.
%        curT    The time of the initial state xCur.
%        a       The drift function in the continuous-time stochastic
%                dynamic model. It takes the state and a time variable
%                as its arguments, a(x,t).
%        D       The diffusion function in the continuous-time stochastic
%                dynamic model. It takes the state and a time variable as
%                its arguments, D(x,t). If the process noise must be
%                additive, D(x,t) should not depend on x.
%       deltaT   The size of the single step over which the strong
%                stochastic Runge-Kutta integration is performed.
%      w,z       A pair of correlated normally distributed random variables
%                whose relationship is defined in section 10.4 of Kloeden.
%                If not provided or an empty matrix is passed, these values
%                are calculated. Either both or neither of these variables
%                must be supplied.
%     dadt       A xDimX1 matrix of the derivative of the drift function
%                with respect to time at state xCur a   nd time curT. This can
%                also be a function that takes the state and a time
%                variable as its arguments, dadt(x,t).
%     dDdt       A xDimXdColDim matrix of the derivative of the diffusion
%                function with respect to time at state xCur and time curT.
%                This can also be a function that takes the state and a
%                time variable as its arguments, dDdt(x,t). If the process
%                noise must be additive, dDdt(x,t) should not depend on x.
%     dadx       A xDimXxDim matrix of the derivative of the drift function
%                with respect to the state at state xCur and time curT.
%                This can also be a function that takes the state and a
%                time variable as its arguments, dadx(x,t).
%    d2adx       A xDimXxDimXxDim matrix of the second derivative of the
%                drift function with respect to the state at state xCur and
%                time curT. The value at point (m,k,l) represents
%                d2a(m)/dx(k)dx(l). This can also be a function that takes
%                the state and a time variable as its arguments,
%                d2adx(x,t). If not provided, this is assumed to be zero.
%OUTPUTS: xSim   The simulated target state at time curT+deltaT.
