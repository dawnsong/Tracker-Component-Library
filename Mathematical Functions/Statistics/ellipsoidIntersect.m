%%ELLIPSOIDINTERSECT Perform ellipsoidal intersection to merge two Gaussian
%                    estimates having an unknown correction. Compare this
%                    function to covarianceIntersect.
%
%INPUTS: xi,Pi The nX1 mean vector and nXn positive definite covariance
%              matrix of the first estimate.
%        xj,Pj The nX1 mean vector and nXn positive definite covariance
%              matrix of the second estimate.
%
%OUTPUTS: x, P The nX1 mean and nXn covariance matrix of the estimate fused
%              using ellipsoidal intersection.
%     gammaVec The mutual mean vector used in the fusion.
%     GammaMat The mutual covariance matrix used in the fusion.
%
%The algorithm in [1] is used, where the mutual mean and covariance matrix
%are defined.. However, rather than using diagonal loading to deal with the
%inverse of a possibly singular matrix in Equation 13b, we use a
%pseudoinverse.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we use the numbers from the example in [1] and we plot ellipsoids.
%Fig. 5 in the paper appears to be in error.
