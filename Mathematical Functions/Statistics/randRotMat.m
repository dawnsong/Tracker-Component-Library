function M=randRotMat(numDim)
%%RANDROTMAT  Generate a uniformely distributed rotation matrix in 2D or
%             3D.
%
%INPUTS: numDim  The number of dimensions of the rotation. This can be
%                either 2 or 3.
%
%OUTPUTS: M  A numDimXnumDim rotation matrix such that M*V rotates the
%            vector v to a uniformely distributed position.
%
%In 2D, there is only one degree of freedom for rotations, so a single
%rotation angle can be chosen uniformely from 0->2*pi. In 3D, there are 3
%degrees of freedom to specify rotations. In n dimensions, there are
%n*(n-1)/2 degrees of freedom.
%
%In 3D, things are more difficult One cannot choose a sequence of
%uniformely distributed set of 3 Euler angles, because the resulting
%rotations will not be uniformely distributed in space. The technique
%chosen here is to choose Euler angles for a zxz rotation series as
%described in 

%where the rotations about the z-axes are uniformely distributed from
%0-2*pi, and the rotation about the x-axis is not uniformly distributed.
%
%Note that general random orthonormal matrices as produced by randOrthoMat
%can have determinantes of +1 or -1, whereal all valid rotation matrices
%have determinante of +1.
