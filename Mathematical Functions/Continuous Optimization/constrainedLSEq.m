function [x,z]=constrainedLSEq(A,b,C,d)
%%CONSTRAINEDLSEQ Find x to minimize norm(A*x-b) under the constraint that
%                 C*x=d. It is assumed that the (m+p)Xn stacked matrix
%                 [A;C] has linearly independent columns (left invertible)
%                 and C has linearly independent rows (right invertible).
%                 This means that p<=n<=m+p. This is equality constrained
%                 least squares.
%
%INPUTS: A A real mXn matrix
%        b A real mX1 vector.
%        C A real pXn matrix.
%        d A real pX1 vector.
%
%OUTPUTS: x The solution to the equality constrained least squares problem.
%           An mX1 vector.
%         z The Lagrange multipliers used in the optimization.
%
%In Chapter 14 of [1], it is shown that x solves the constrained least
%squares problem if and only if there exists a z such that
%[A'*A, C'; C, zeros(p,p)]*[x;z]=[A'*b;d]
%This is a set of n+p equations and unknowns. Thus, this function just
%solves the above system of equations. z is a set of Lagrange multipliers.
