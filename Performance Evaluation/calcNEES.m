function NEES=calcNEES(xTrue,xEst,PEst)
%CALCNEES  Given a batch of estimates and associated true target states,
%          compute the normalized estimation error squared. This version is
%          normalized such that the mean of a consistent estimator,
%          regardless of the dimensionality of the state, should be one.
%
%INPUTS: xTrue  The truth data. If the truth is the same for all samples of
%               the estimate, then this is an xDimX1 vector. Otherwise,
%               this is an xDimXN matrix where N is the number of
%               samples in the batch.
%        xEst   An xDim X N set of estimates.
%        PEst   An xDim X xDim XN set of covariance matrices associated
%               with the estimates. if the covariance matrix is supposed to
%               be the same for all estimates, then PEst is just xDimXxDim.
%
%OUTPUTS: NEES  The normalized estimation error squared of the estimates.
%
%The NEES is a measure of how well the provided by an estimator matches the
%actual accuracy of the estimates. The concept of the NEES is discussed in 
%"Basic Tracking Using Nonlinear 3D monostatic and Bistatic Measurements by
%David F. Crouse.
