function h=plotMapOnEllipsoid(path2Map,a,f)
%PLOTMAPONELLIPSOID  Plot a map image, where the pixels are given in terms
%                    of an equirectangular projection, on an ellipsoidal
%                    Earth with a black background. This can be useful for
%                    plotting target trajectories on a 3D Earth.
%
%INPUTS: path2Map  A string with the path to the mapfile to load. This
%                  should be an image file format that the imread command
%                  can read, such as .png or .jpg. It should also be an
%                  equirectangular projection. That is, each pixel has a
%                  constant width in latitude and longitude. If this
%                  parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
%                  the file ./data/NASABlueMarble.jpg is used, where .
%                  refers to the directory of this file.
%           a      The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                  this argument is omitted, the value in
%                  Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f      The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                  this argument is omitted, the value in
%                  Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUTS:  h      The handle to the surfaceplot object created.
%
%This function turns the axes off when plotting and sets the scaling to
%'equal'.
