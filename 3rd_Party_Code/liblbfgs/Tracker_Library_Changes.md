The library has been modified by moving line_search_backtracking, line_search_backtracking_owlqn, and line_search_morethuente non-static and moved prototypes into lbfgs.h so the line search methods can be used by other functions. Also, the declaration of tag_callback_data into lbfgs.h and checks for MATLAB_MEX_FILE were added to the code dealing with memory allocation and deallocation to ease the integration into Matlab.
