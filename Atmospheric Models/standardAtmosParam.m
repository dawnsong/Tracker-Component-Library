%%STANDARDATMOSPARAM  Get basic parameters for atmospheric refractivity,
%                     density, pressure and temperature from
%                     a standard atmospheric model. The model is best
%                     suited for altitudes below 90km.
%
%INPUTS:    Jul1, Jul2  Two parts of a pseudo-Julian date given in UTC.
%                       The units of the date are days. The full date is
%                       the sum of both terms. The date is broken into two
%                       parts to provide more bits of precision. It does
%                       not matter how the date is split.
%           point       The [x;y;x] Cartesian location under consideration
%                       in 3D ECEF coordinates with units of meters.
%           rhow        An optional parameter specifying the mass density
%                       of water vapor at the point in question in units of
%                       kilograms per cubic meter. If omitted, the air is
%                       assumed to be dry (rhow=0). The total density of
%                       the air is assumed to be the sum of the dry air
%                       density and rhow.
%
%OUTPUTS:   N           The refractivity of the atmosphere. In this model,
%                       N is always real. N=10^6*(n-1) where n is the index
%                       of refraction. This is generally valid for
%                       frequencies from L-band (1GHz) to 10 GHz (the
%                       middle of X-band).
%           rho         The atmospheric density at the point in question in
%                       units of kilograms per cubic meter. 
%           T           The temperature at the point in question with units
%                       of degrees Kelvin.
%           P           The atmospheric pressure at the point in question
%                       in units of Newtons per square meter (Pascals). It
%                       assumes that the gasses can be treated as ideal
%                       gasses.
%
%The dry air density and temperature is obtained from the NRLMSISE-00
%atmospheric model using the default parameters for magnetic and solar
%parameters, which are generally valid below 90km, using the function
%standAtmosGasTemp. The refractive index is then found using the dry and
%wet air densities using the formula of
%J. M. Aparicio and S. Laroche, "An evaluation of the expression of
%the atmospheric refractivity for GPS signals," Journal of Geophysical
%Research, vol. 116, no. D11, 16 Jun. 2011.
%which should be valid for frequencies between 1GHz and 10GHz. It ignores
%the lossiness of the atmosphere.
%
%The atmospheric pressure is obtained using the Ideal Gas Law as described
%in THE NRLMSISE-00 AND HWM-93 USERS GUIDE: Version 1.50, November 2003 by
%Douglas P. Drob.
%
%The anomalous oxygen parameter in the NRLMSISE-00 model is not used.
