%%ASPIRALSIMP The drift function for a non-ballistic spiraling target
%         motion model in 3 dimensions, formulated in a manner such that it
%         si simple to make a spiraling target follow a nominal trajectory.
%         This model is probably bad to design into a target tracking
%         algorithm, but might be good for designing spiraling trajectories
%         to use to test target tracking algorithms.
%
%INPUTS: xPoints The target state at time t. It consists of position 
%                (3 elements), instantaneous velocity (3 elements), the
%                velocity vector (3 elements) of the overall direction of
%                motion of the spiraling model (ground speed) and the
%                spiral rate of the target. Thus xDim=10. If x is an
%                xDim X numStates matrix, then the spiraling model is
%                evaluated for all of the state vectors.
%        t       An unused time component so that aSpiral can be used with
%                Runge-Kutta methods that expect the function to take two
%                parameters.
%
%OUTPUTS: aVals The flat-Earth time-derivative of the state.
%
%A derivation of the simplified flat-Earth spiraling dynamic model is given
%in [1].
