function val=aPolarLin2D(x,t,T)
%APOLARLIN2D  The drift function for a 2D continuous-time constant heading
%             motion model where the target state is given in terms of
%             position, direction of velocity in radians counterclockwise
%             from the x-axis, and speed. Optionally, a speed derivative
%             component can be given to model possible linear target
%             acceleration.
%
%INPUTS:    x The 4XN set of target state vectors in 2D space in the order
%             of [2D position;direction angle;speed] where the heading
%             angle is measured in radians counterclockwise from the
%             x-axis. Alternatively, a 5XN state vector of
%             [2D position;direction angle;speed; speed derivative] can be
%             used to cover a linearly accelerating target.
%           t An unused time component so that aPolar2DCV can be used with
%             Runge-Kutta methods that expect the function to take two
%             parameters.
%          T  The time-duration of the propagation interval in seconds.
%             This is only needed when linear acceleration is included.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The 4XN or 5XN set of time-derivatives of the state under the
%             constant heading motion model.
%
%The idea of decomposing the velocity into direction and speed components
%is presented in [1], where the direction component is differently defined
%and derivative for a turning model are used. 
%
%This drift function goes with the diffusion matrix DPolarLin2D.
