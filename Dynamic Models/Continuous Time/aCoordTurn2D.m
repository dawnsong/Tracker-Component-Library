function val= aCoordTurn2D(x,t,turnType,tauTurn,tauLinAccel)
%%ACOORDTURN2D The continuous-time drift function for a 2D coordinated turn
%              model with a Cartesian state. The turn rate can be specified
%              in terms of a turn rate in radians per second, or in terms
%              of a transversal acceleration. Additionally, a linear
%              acceleration can be given. The turn rate and linear
%              acceleration can optionally have time constants associated
%              with them, like in the Singer model, modelling a tendancy to
%              eventually want to return to non-accelerating, straight-line
%              motion.
%
%INPUTS:  x  The target state for 2D motion. If there is no linear
%            acceleration (acceleration along the direction of motion),
%            then x can either be x=[x;y;xdot;ydot;omega], where omega is
%            the turn rate estimate in radians per second
%            counterclockwise from the x-axis or x=[x;y;xdot;ydot;at] where
%            at is the the transversal acceleration, which is orthogonal to
%            the velocity and is defined such that positive values of at
%            map to positive values of omega. If there is a linear
%            acceleration, then the target state is either
%            x=[x;y;xdot;ydot;omega;al] where omega is the turn rate and al
%            is the linear acceleration or the target state is
%            x=[x;y;xdot;ydot;at;al] if the turn is expressed in terms of a
%            transversal acceleration. The dimensionality of the state is
%            used to determine whether a linear acceleration component is
%            present. The linear acceleration component changes the speed.
%            That means that it acts in the direction of the velocity
%            vector.
%          t An unused time component so that aCoordTurn2D can be used with
%            Runge-Kutta methods that expect the function to take two
%            parameters.
%  turnType  A string specifying whether the turn is given in terms of a
%            turn rate in radians per second or a transversal acceleration
%            in m/s^2. Possible values are
%            'TurnRate'   The turn is specified in terms of a turn rate
%                         (The default if this parameter is omitted).
%            'TransAccel' The turn is specified in terms of a transversal
%                         acceleration.
%   tauTurn  The correlation time constant for the turn rate in seconds.
%            tau must be positive but does not have to be finite. If this
%            parameter is omitted, then tauTurn is set to infinity.
%tauLinAccel The correlation time constant for the linear acceleration (if
%            present) in seconds. This parameter is not needed if there is
%            no linear acceleration. If a linear acceleration is present
%            and this parameter is omitted, then tauLinAccel is set to
%            infinity.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The time-derivative of the state under the 2D coordinated
%             turn model.
%
%The basic 2D coordinated turn model in Cartesian coordinates is described
%in Section VA of [1]. When the turn rate is something that must be
%estimated, it is assumed that the continuous-time turn rate model is
%omegaDot=-(1/tauTurn)*Omega+noise
%Note that the ordering of the state elements assumed by this function
%differs from the ordering of the state elements assumed in [1].
%
%The 2D coordinates turn model in Cartesian coordinates is also described
%in Chapter 4.2.3 of [2].
%
%The concept of using the transversal acceleration instead of the turn rate
%is not discussed in either of those references. It is, however, mentioned
%in [3], though no differential equations are given and a more detailed
%reference cited therein is a hard-to-get dissertation in French. The use
%of transversal acceleration is discussed in more detail in [4], though
%expressions are given when considering the 2D velocity are broken
%into components of heading and speed rather than in Cartesian space. The
%generalization to Cartesian space is not difficult and is done here.
%
%It can be shown that the magnitude of the transverse acceleration is equal
%to the speed times the turn rate. The model utilizing the transverse
%acceleration comes naturally from there. The relationship to the time
%constant in the transverse acceleration model comes from how it related to
%the derivative of the turn rate in [1].
%
%The optional linear acceleration provides a derivative of the speed of the
%target. The time constant operates in the same manner as the time constant
%for the turn rate. That is,
%alDot=-(1/tauLinAccel)*al+noise
%This is similar to how (total) acceleration decays in the Singer dynamic
%model, which was described in [5].
%
%The formulation in terms of transverse acceleration contains a singularity
%in the computation of the implied turn rate if the speed is zero. In such
%an instance, the turn rate is just set to zero. Similarly, singularities
%exist in applying the linear acceleration when the velocity of the target
%is zero. Values are zero are also substituted in such instances.
%
%The corresponding diffusion matrix is given by the function DCoordTurn2D.
%The corresponding discrete-time functions are FCoordTurn2D and
%QCoordTurn2D. However, note that the discrete-time functions are
%direct-discrete models and not discretizations of the continuous-time
%models as the propagated PDF does not remain Gaussian over time.
