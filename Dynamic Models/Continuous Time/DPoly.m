function D=DPoly(x,t,q0,order,numDim)
%%DPOLY       The diffusion matrix for a continuous-time additive noise 
%             model in numDim dimensions of motion with order moments of
%             position whereby the noise is only added to the highest-order
%             derivatives of position when used with a linear motion model.
%             When order=1, this is the continuous white noise acceleration
%             (CWNA) model. When order=2, this is the continuous Wiener
%             process acceleration model (CWPA), also known as the white
%             noise jerk model.
%
%INPUTS:   x  The target state(s). Only the second dimension is used to 
%             indicate the number of D matrices to be returned (the third
%             dimension of the D matrix, The basic additive noise model
%             does not depend on the target state. To be consistent with
%             the other parameters x should be a (order+1)*numDim X
%             N, where N is the number of D matrices on the output. If an
%             empty matrix is apssed, it is assumed that 
%          t  The time at which the diffusion matrix is desired. This is
%             unused, since the diffusion matrix in the basic additive
%             noise model is time-invariant. This is here so that DPoly
%             can be used with Runge-Kutta methods that expect the function
%             to take two arguments.
%        q0   The power spectral density of the noise for each dimension.
%             If the power spectral density of the noise is the same in all
%             dimensions, the a scalar q0 can be passed.
%      order  The order >=0 of the filter. If order=1, then it is 
%             constant velocity, 2 means constant acceleration, 3 means
%             constant jerk, etc. If this parameter is omitted, then
%             order=1 is assumed.
%      numDim The number of dimensions of the simulation problem. If
%             the numDim parameter is omitted, then numDim=3 (3D motion)
%             is assumed.
%
%OUTPUT: D    The diffusion matrix of a continuous-time linear additive
%             noise model where the noise is only added to the highest
%             order terms of the state. If the input x has multiple
%             columns, then the same number of copies of D are returned
%             with D(:,:,i) being the ith one.
%
%It is assumed that the state is ordered
%[position;velocity;acceleration;etc] for up to order moments of
%numDim-dimensional position. 
%
%Continuous-time additive noise models are discussed in more detail in [1].
%
%This diffusion matrix corresponds to the discrete-time process noise
%generated by the function QPolyKal.
