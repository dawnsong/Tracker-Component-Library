function [col4row,row4col,gain,u,v]=assign2D(C,maximize)
%%ASSIGN2D          Solve the two-dimensional assignment problem with a
%                   rectangular cost matrix C, scanning row-wise. The
%                   problem being solved can be formulated as
%                   minimize (or maximize)
%                   \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}\sum_{j=1}^{numCol}C_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%                   subject to
%                   \sum_{j=1}^{numCol}x_{i,j} =1 for all i
%                   \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}x_{i,j}<=1 for all j
%                   x_{i,j}=0 or 1.
%                   Assuming that numCol>=numRow.
%
%INPUTS:    C           A numRowXnumCol cost matrix that does not contain
%                       any NaNs and where the largest finite element minus
%                       the smallest element is a finite quantity (does not
%                       overflow) when performing minimization and where
%                       the smallest finite element minus the largest
%                       element is finite when performing maximization. 
%                       Forbidden assignments can be given costs of +Inf
%                       for minimization and -Inf for maximization.
%           maximize    If true, the minimization problem is transformed
%                       into a maximization problem. The default if this
%                       parameter is omitted is false.
%
%OUTPUTS:   col4row     A numRowX1 vector where the entry in each element
%                       is an assignment of the element in that row to a
%                       column. 0 entries signify unassigned rows.
%           row4col     A numColX1 vector where the entry in each element
%                       is an assignment of the element in that column to a
%                       row. 0 entries signify unassigned columns.
%           gain        The sum of the values of the assigned elements in
%                       C.
%           u           The dual variable for the columns.
%           v           The dual variable for the rows.
%
%DEPENDENCIES: None
%
%If the number of rows is <= the number of columns, then every row is
%assigned to one column; otherwise every column is assigned to one row. The
%assignment minimizes the sum of the assigned elements (the gain).
%During minimization, assignments can be forbidden by placing Inf in
%elements. During maximization, assignment can be forbidden by placing -Inf
%in elements. The cost matrix can not contain any -Inf elements during
%minimization nor any +Inf elements during maximization to try to force an
%assignment. If no complete assignment can be made with finite cost,
%then col4row and row4col are empty and gain is set to -1.
%
%Note that the dual variables produced by a shortest path assignment
%algorithm that scans by row are not interchangeable with those of a
%shortest path assignment algorithm that scans by column. Matlab stores
%matrices row-wise. Additionally, the dual variables are only valid for the
%transformed cost matrix on which optimization is actually performed, which
%is not necessarily the original cost matrix provided.
%
%When performing minimization with all positive array elements, the initial
%preprocessing step only changes the returned dual variables by offsetting
%the u values by -min(min(C)). Adding min(min(C)) to the returned u values,
%one can get what the dual variables would have been without the
%preprocessing step.
%
%The algorithm is described in detail in [1] and [2].
