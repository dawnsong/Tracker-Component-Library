The Tracker Component Library is a collection of Matlab routines\r\n(some written in C/C++ requiring compilation compilation) for simulating and\r\ntracking targets in various scenarios. Due to the complexity of the target\r\ntracking problem, a great many routines can find use in other areas\r\nincluding combinatorics, astronomy, and statistics.\r\n\r\nThose looking to get a quick idea of a very simple end-to-end tracking\r\nalgorithm (track initiation, data association, maintenance, and\r\ntermination) might want to look at\r\n./Sample Code/Basic Tracking Examples/demo2DIntegratedDataAssociation.m\r\nto see an example of a complete GNN-JIPDAF tracker run on a simple 2D\r\ntracking scenario, which can be easily transformed into a normal JIPDAF\r\nby changing a single parameter. The tracker is made from the modular\r\ncomponents of the library and adapting the tracker to 3D and other\r\nscenarios is as simple as changing the proper components. A lot of other\r\nsample code is also provided to demonstrate the use of other parts of the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nDue to GitHub's limit that files not exceed 100MB, the ephemeris data file\r\nfor the astronomical code has been omitted. To use any of the files\r\nrequiring planetary ephemerides, such as solarBodyVec.m, please download\r\nthe file de430.bsp from\r\nhttp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/ and place it\r\nin the folder \"Astronomical Code/data\".\r\n\r\n## COMPILED CODE:\r\n\r\nThe library has been tested under Matlab2016a for Windows 7 and Mac OS X\r\n10.10. However, most of it should work under other versions of Matlab and\r\nunder other operating systems.  To use the full library, add the library\r\nand all of its subfolders to your active path in Matlab. Some functions are\r\navailable as C/C++ files for use in Matlab either because they use third-\r\nparty libraries or because the native Matlab implementations provided are\r\ntoo slow to use. If the library was downloaded without precompiled versions\r\nof these files, then they can be compiled by running the CompileCLibraries\r\nfunction. Note that a C/C++ compiler supported by Matlab must be\r\ninstalled. Additionally, to decode AIS data, the compiler must support\r\nC++11. As thie commands for the compilation of the AIS data are at the end\r\nof the CompileCLibraries function,\r\n\r\n## EXTERNAL SOLVERS:\r\n\r\nThe folder\r\n./Mathematical Functions/Polynomials/Generic Multivariate Polynomials/\r\ncontains the function solvePolySysWithExtProg. This is an interface to\r\nexternal solvers for simultaneous multivariate polynomial systems. The\r\nsolvers are external programs and are not included. Though the functions\r\npolyRootsMultiDim and solveQuadBivarEq can solver certain types of\r\nsimultaneous multivariate polynomials, they are limited. For more general\r\nsystems, an external solver is the best choice. The functions\r\npolyMeasConvert, polyMeasConvertAsync, and DopplerOnlyInit6D are located in\r\nsubfolders entitled 'Uses External Solver\" and use the function\r\nsolvePolySysWithExtProg. Supported external solvers for the function\r\nsolvePolySysWithExtProg are PHCpack, Bertini, and the certified solver in\r\nMacaulay2. Note that Macaulay2 tends to fail more often than the other\r\nsolvers.\r\n\r\nThe solvers can be downloaded from:\r\nPHCpack for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux:\r\nhttp://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html\r\nBertini (version 1.5) for Mac OS X and Linux and Windows, only with Cygwin:\r\nhttps://bertini.nd.edu/download.html\r\nMacaulay2 for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows:\r\nhttp://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/\r\n\r\nFor the external solvers to work, they need to be added to the search path\r\nused in Matlab so that the phs/bertini/m2 commands can be called using the\r\nsystem command in Matlab.\r\n\r\n## DATA SOURCES:\r\n\r\nIf the library was downloaded without associated data files for solar\r\nsystem ephemerides as well as magnetic, gravitational and terrain models,\r\nthen the relevant data files will have to be downloaded The original \r\nsources of the data are:\r\n\r\n1) Earth2014 terrain model:\r\nhttps://geodesy.curtin.edu.au/research/harmonic/\r\nThe files Earth2014.BED2014.degree2160.bshc,\r\nEarth2014.ICE2014.degree2160.bshc, Earth2014.RET2014.degree2160.bshc,\r\nEarth2014.SUR2014.degree2160.bshc, Earth2014.TBI2014.degree2160.bshc should\r\nbe placed into ./Terrain/data . Though data files to degree and order\r\n10,800 are also available, they are not currently supported as the function\r\nspherHarmonicEval does not use extended precision arithmetic, which is\r\nrequired to avoid overflows when using the model.\r\n\r\n2) EGM2008 terrain model (The DTM2006.0 model):\r\nhttp://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/first_release.html\r\nThe file Coeff_Height_and_Depth_to2190_DTM2006.0 should be placed into \r\n./Terrain/data . The first time using the getEGM2008TerrainCoeffs function\r\nwill be significantly slower than subsequent calls, assuming the full model\r\nis loaded the first time.\r\n\r\n3) The EMM2015 magnetic field coefficients:\r\nhttps://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/EMM/\r\nThe coefficients are included with the software that is provided. The files\r\nhaving names like EMM2015.COF and EMM2000.COF should all be zipped into an\r\narchive with the name EMM_Coefficients.zip and placed in ./Magnetism/data .\r\nThe files with names like EMM2015SV.COF andEMM2000SV.COF should all be\r\nzipped into an archive with the name EMM_Secular_Variations.zip and placed\r\ninto ./Magnetism/data . If all of the data for a single year is loaded,\r\nthen a .mat file containing the data is placed in  the data folder to speed\r\nup subsequent calls to the function.\r\n\r\n4) The IGRF12 magnetic field coefficients:\r\nhttp://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html\r\nThe file http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf12coeffs.txt can be\r\ndownloaded and placed into the folder ./Magnetism/data .\r\n\r\n5) The WMM magnetic field coefficients:\r\nhttps://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml\r\nThe coefficient file WMM2015COF.zip shown be downloaded, unzipped and the\r\nfile WMM.COF placed into ./Magnetism/data .\r\n\r\n6) EGM2008 gravitational coefficients\r\nhttp://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/egm08_wgs84.html\r\nDownload the file  EGM2008_to2190_TideFree.gz, which is under \"EGM2008 Tide\r\nFree Spherical Harmonic Coefficients\". Decompress the file and place it in\r\n./Gravity/data .\r\n\r\n7) EGM96 gravitational coefficients\r\nhttp://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html\r\nThe file egm96.z should be downloaded and decompressed, resulting in a file\r\nnames egm96 without an extension, which should be placed in\r\n./Gravity/data .\r\n\r\n8) EGM2008 parameters needed to convert height anomalies to geoid\r\n   undulations:\r\nhttp://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/egm08_wgs84.html\r\nThe \"Correction Model\" file Zeta-to-N_to2160_egm2008.gz should be\r\ndownloaded, ungzipped and placed in ./Gravity/data .\r\n\r\n9) EGM96 parameters needed to convert height anomalies to geoid\r\n   undulations:\r\nhttp://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html\r\nThe file corrcoef.z should be decompressed and placed in ./Gravity/data .\r\n\r\n10) NASA JPL's GL0900C gravitational model of the Moon\r\nhttp://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/grail/default.htm\r\nDownload the file jggrx_0900c_sha.tab and place it in ./Gravity/data .\r\n\r\n11) The FES2004 tide model of the effects of ocean Earth tides.\r\nhttp://maia.usno.navy.mil/conv2010/convupdt/convupdt_c6.html\r\nThe file fes2004_Cnm-Snm.dat should be downloaded and placed in\r\n./Gravity/Tides/data .\r\n\r\n12) The DE430 planetary/solar ephemerides\r\nhttp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/\r\nPlace the file de430.bsp in ./Astronomical Code/data .\r\n\r\n13) The DE 421 Lunar ephemerides\r\nhttp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/\r\nThe file file moon_pa_de421_1900-2050.bpc should be downloaded and placed\r\nin ./Astronomical Code/data .\r\n\r\n14) The definitions of the lunar coordinate systems in the DE 421 \r\nhttp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/fk/satellites/\r\nThe file moon_080317.tf should be downloaded and placed in\r\n./Astronomical Code/data .\r\n \r\n15) The Hipparcos 2 Star Catalog\r\nhttp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/311\r\nPlace the file hip2.dat in ./Astronomical Code/data .\r\n",
