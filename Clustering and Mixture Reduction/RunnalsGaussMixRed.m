%%RUNNALSGAUSSMIXRED  Perform Gaussian mixture Reduction using the greedy
%                     mergin algorithm by Runnals.
%
%INPUTS: w      A NX1 vector of weights of the components of the original
%               Gaussian mixture.
%        mu     An xDimXN matrix of the means of the vector components of
%               the original Gaussian mixture.
%        P      An xDim XxDim XN hypermatrix of the covariance matrices for
%               the components of the original Gaussian mixture.
%        K      The number of components desired in the mixture after
%               reduction.
%
%OUTPUTS: w     The weights of the mixture after reduction.
%         mu    The means of the mixture after reduction.
%         P     The covariance matrices of the mixture after reduction.
%
%This implements the suboptimal Gaussian mixture reduction algorithm of
%[1]. Note that a real efficient C/C++ implementation would be implemented
%using various data structures to avoid the cost deletion and inseration of
%matrix elements that is used in the reduction algorithm.
